# Sorcerer's Stone (SorceStone)

## Project Overview

Sorcerer's Stone is an open-source project aimed at providing a semi-automatic framework for converting C code into Rust with predictable outcomes, leveraging advanced AI capabilities.

## Inspiration and Background

The project is inspired by critical cybersecurity research and government initiatives focusing on memory safety, including:
- [CISA/NSA Software Memory Safety Roadmap](https://media.defense.gov/2022/Nov/10/2003112742/-1/-1/1/CSI_SOFTWARE_MEMORY_SAFETY.PDF)
- [CISA Cybersecurity Authorities Guide on Memory Safe Roadmaps](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/news/cisa-nsa-fbi-and-international-cybersecurity-authorities-publish-guide-case-memory-safe-roadmaps)

## Project Goals

The primary objectives of Sorcerer's Stone are to:
- Develop a semi-automatic framework for translating C code to Rust
- Ensure predictable code conversion outcomes
- Leverage cutting-edge AI capabilities to improve code translation

## Relationship to Other Initiatives

While inspired by initiatives like the [DARPA Translating All C to Rust](https://www.darpa.mil/research/programs/translating-all-c-to-rust) program, Sorcerer's Stone is an independent project and is not officially affiliated with DARPA.
